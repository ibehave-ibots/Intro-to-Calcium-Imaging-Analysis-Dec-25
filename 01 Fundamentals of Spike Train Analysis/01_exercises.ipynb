    "Great figures distil complex data into straightforward visual messages. In this final section we’ll polish our initial plots—adjusting tick marks, colours, and labels—to make them easy for colleagues (and reviewers!) to interpret at a glance. You’ll see how small aesthetic tweaks, applied systematically, raise a figure from “good enough” to “communicates instantly,” a skill that pays dividends in every presentation and paper you create.\n",

    "**Exercise**: Below is the raster plot from the last section.  It's nice, but it contains extra elements that don't have meaning in the plot, and it is missing some information to help interpret the data.  Let's improve it!  Make the following improvements to the plot:\n",
    "  1. Since the y-axis doesn't have meaning, here it can confuse readers.  We can hide it with `utils.remove_spines()\n",
    "  2. Hide the y-axis values with `plotutils.yticks(None)`\n",

    "  5. The box around the plot (called the \"spines\") aren't really adding any information here.  Let's remove them with `plotutils.remove_spines()`.\n",
